# Scannorder
Scannorder is a web application that allows customers to scan a QR code and place orders at restaurants. It's an affordable alternative to Point of Sale (POS) systems for restaurants looking to digitize their operations. Scannorder enables restaurants to manage their orders, collect payments, and handle rewards, all within a single platform.

## Problem Statement
Scannorder is a web app that simplifies the restaurant ordering process for both customers and restaurant owners. By enabling customers to scan a QR code and place orders from their phone, it reduces the need for physical menus and paper receipts. Additionally, it provides restaurant owners with an easy-to-use interface for managing their inventory, tracking orders, collecting payments, and managing rewards.

## How It Works
Scannorder works as follows:

## Customer Story:
- The customer logs in with their phone number and receives a one-time password (OTP).
- The customer scans the restaurant's QR code to view the menu and selects their items.
- The customer places the order and submits payment using a credit/debit card or other digital payment methods.
- The customer can also send rewards to other customers by phone number.

## Restaurant Story:
- The restaurant owner logs in with their email and password to register their restaurant profile.
- The restaurant owner adds their menu, payment methods, and rewards percentage (percentage of order value that can be shared with a different user as rewards on the purchase of the same restaurant).
- The restaurant owner views and completes orders, collects payments, and manages their inventory.
- The restaurant owner can view analytics on their sales and customer feedback.

## Technologies Used
Scannorder is built using React, Firebase, and Stripe API. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Firebase is a backend service that provides authentication, database, storage, and cloud functions. Stripe API is used to process payments and manage rewards.
